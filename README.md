This is an ASP .NET Core API that offers an endpoint for actors, characters, directors, franchises, and movies.
The API is created with Entity Framework Core and uses a Repository Pattern handle CRUD operations. The data is further decoupled from the domain with data transfer objects used in the controllers.

The API is documented with a Swagger file displayed in a UI at startup of the application.
The project includes a Postman Collection with request and responses for testing CRUD operations in the API. The project also includes a database script that shows the relationships to the entities with data.
